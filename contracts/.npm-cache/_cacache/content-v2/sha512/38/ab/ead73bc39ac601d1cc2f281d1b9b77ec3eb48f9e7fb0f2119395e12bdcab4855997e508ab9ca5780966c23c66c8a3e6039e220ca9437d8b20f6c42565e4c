If *progressCallback* is\nprovided, it is periodically called with a single parameter, a number between 0 and\n1 (inclusive) indicating the completion progress; it will **always** emit 0 at the\nbeginning and 1 at the end, and numbers between may repeat.\n\n**scrypt . syncScrypt ( password , salt , N , r , p , dkLen )** *=> Uint8Array*\n\nCompute the scrypt PBKDF synchronously. Keep in mind this may stall UI and other tasks and the\nasynchronous version is highly preferred.\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <div><span id=\"progress\"></span>% complete...</div>\n    <!-- These two libraries are highly recommended for encoding password/salt -->\n    <script src=\"libs/buffer.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n\n    <!-- This shim library greatly improves performance of the scrypt algorithm -->\n    <script src=\"libs/setImmediate.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n\n    <script src=\"index.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\n      // See the section below: \"Encoding Notes\"\n      const password = new buffer.SlowBuffer(\"anyPassword\".normalize('NFKC'));\n      const salt = new buffer.SlowBuffer(\"someSalt\".normalize('NFKC'));\n\n      const N = 1024, r = 8, p = 1;\n      const dkLen = 32;\n\n      function updateInterface(progress) {\n          document.getElementById(\"progress\").textContent = Math.trunc(100 * progress);\n      }\n\n      // Async\n      const keyPromise = scrypt.scrypt(password, salt, N, r, p, dkLen, updateInterface);\n\n      keyPromise.then(function(key) {\n          console.log(\"Derived Key (async): \", key);\n      });\n\n      // Sync\n      const key = scrypt.syncScrypt(password, salt, N, r, p, dkLen);\n      console.log(\"Derived Key (sync): \", key);\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nEncoding Notes\n--------------\n\n```\nTL;DR - either only allow ASCII characters in passwords, or use\n        String.prototype.normalize('NFKC') on any password\n```\n\nIt is *HIGHLY* recommended that you do **NOT** pass strings into this (or any password-base key derivation function) library without careful consideration; you should convert your strings to a canonical format that you will use consistently across all platforms.\n\nWhen encoding passwords with UTF-8, it is important to realize that there may be multiple UTF-8 representations of a given string. Since the key generated by a password-base key derivation function is *dependent on the specific bytes*, this matters a great deal.\n\n**Composed vs. Decomposed**\n\nCertain UTF-8 code points can be combined with other characters to create composed characters. For example, the letter *a with the umlaut diacritic mark* (two dots over it) can be expressed two ways; as its composed form, U+00FC; or its decomposed form, which is the letter \"u\" followed by U+0308 (which basically means modify the previous character by adding an umlaut to it).\n\n```javascript\n// In the following two cases, a \"u\" with an umlaut would be seen\n> '\\u00fc'\n> 'u\\u0308'\n\n\n// In its composed form, it is 2 bytes long\n> new Buffer('u\\u0308'.normalize('NFKC'))\n<Buffer c3 bc>\n> new Buffer('\\u00fc')\n<Buffer c3 bc>\n\n// Whereas the decomposed form is 3 bytes, the letter u followed by U+0308\n> new Buffer('\\u00fc'.normalize('NFKD'))\n<Buffer 75 cc 88>\n> new Buffer('u\\u0308')\n<Buffer 75 cc 88>\n```\n\n\n**Compatibility equivalence mode**\n\nCertain strings are often displayed the same, even though they may have different semantic means. For example, UTF-8 provides a code point for the roman number for one, which appears as the letter I, in most fonts identically. Compatibility equivalence will fold these two cases into simply the capital letter I.\n\n```\n> '\\u2160'\n'I'\n> 'I'\n'I'\n> '\\u2160' === 'I'\nfalse\n> '\\u2160'.normalize('NFKC') === 'I'\ntrue\n```\n\n\n**Normalizing**\n\nThe `normalize()` method of a string can be used to convert a string to a\nspecific form. Without going into too much detail, I generally recommend\n`NFKC`, however if you wish to dive deeper into this, a nice short summary\ncan be found in Pythons [unicodedata module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.normalize)'s\ndocumentation.\n\nFor browsers without `normalize()` support, the [npm unorm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unorm)\ncan be used to polyfill strings.\n\n\n**Another example of encoding woes**\n\nOne quick story I will share is a project which used the `SHA256(encodeURI(password))` as\na key, which (ignoring [rainbow table attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table))\nhad an unfortunate consequence of old web browsers replacing spaces with `+` while on new web\nbrowsers, replacing it with a `%20`, causing issues for anyone who used spaces in their password.\n\n\n### Suggestions\n\n- While it may be inconvenient to many international users, one option is to restrict passwords to a safe subset of ASCII, for example: `/^[A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&*()]+$/`.\n- My personal recommendation is to normalize to the NFKC form, however, one could imagine setting their password to a Chinese phrase on one computer, and then one day using a computer that does not have Chinese input capabilities and therefore be unable to log in.\n\n**See:**
