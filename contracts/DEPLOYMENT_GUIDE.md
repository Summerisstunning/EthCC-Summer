# üåê Flow EVM Deployment Guide - AA Sharing Smart Contract

## üìã Current Status
‚úÖ **Smart Contract Ready**: AASharing.sol is production-ready for Flow Mainnet EVM  
‚úÖ **Deployment Tools Configured**: Hardhat + ethers.js setup complete  
‚úÖ **Frontend Integration Ready**: ABI and configuration files prepared  
‚è≥ **Pending**: Private key setup for mainnet deployment  

## üöÄ Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Set Up Your Private Key
Create a `.env` file in the `/contracts` directory:
```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env

# Add your Flow private key (keep this secure!)
echo "FLOW_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here" >> .env
```

### 2. Ensure FLOW Balance
- Your Flow address: `0x000000000000000000000002D399f1eB0b5CF334`
- Check balance at: https://evm.flowscan.org/address/0x000000000000000000000002D399f1eB0b5CF334
- Need minimum ~0.1 FLOW for gas fees

### 3. Deploy to Flow Mainnet EVM
```bash
cd contracts
npm run deploy
# OR
node deploy-simple.js
```
