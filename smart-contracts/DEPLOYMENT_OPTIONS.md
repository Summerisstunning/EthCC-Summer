# 🚀 Flow Mainnet Deployment Options

## 📊 Current Status

✅ **Smart Contracts**: Ready for deployment  
✅ **Network Connection**: Flow Mainnet connected  
❌ **Account Balance**: Insufficient FLOW for deployment  

## 💰 Balance Status

| Address | Balance | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Current (`0x6a43...F7`) | 0.0 FLOW | ❌ Insufficient |
| Target (`0x0000...334`) | 0.1 FLOW | ⚠️ Minimal |

## 🎯 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Fund Current Address (Recommended)

Send **0.15 FLOW** to current deployment address:
```
Address: 0x6a439aA69fe1ae418a15d342301a66503D3654F7
Amount: 0.15 FLOW (with safety margin)
```

After funding, run:
```bash
npm run deploy:flowMainnet
```

### Option 2: Use Target Address Private Key

If you have the private key for `0x000000000000000000000002D399f1eB0b5CF334`:

1. Replace private key in `.env`:
```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=target_address_private_key_here
```

2. Deploy (0.1 FLOW should be just enough):
```bash
npm run deploy:flowMainnet
```

### Option 3: Reduce Deployment Scope

Deploy minimal contracts first:
```bash
# Deploy only essential contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-minimal.js --network flowMainnet
```

## 📊 Deployment Cost Breakdown

| Contract | Estimated Cost |
|----------|---------------|
| Mock USDC | ~0.015 FLOW |
| AA Sharing | ~0.035 FLOW |
| CrossChain Bridge | ~0.025 FLOW |
| Setup & Config | ~0.010 FLOW |
| **Total** | **~0.085 FLOW** |
| **Recommended Balance** | **0.15 FLOW** |

## 🎯 Recommended Action

**Fund the current address with 0.15 FLOW:**

1. **From Flow Wallet/Exchange**: Send 0.15 FLOW to `0x6a439aA69fe1ae418a15d342301a66503D3654F7`
2. **Wait for confirmation** (usually 1-2 minutes)
3. **Run deployment**: `npm run deploy:flowMainnet`

## 📱 How to Get FLOW

1. **Flow Port Wallet**: https://wallet.flow.com
2. **Exchanges**: Binance, Coinbase, Kraken

**💡 Tip**: Target address (`0x000000000000000000000002D399f1eB0b5CF334`) has exactly 0.1 FLOW, which might be just enough if you prefer to use its private key instead.
